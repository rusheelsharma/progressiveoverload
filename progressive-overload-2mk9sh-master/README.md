# Progressive Overload

- [Build me an app -- 3](https://www.freelancer.com/projects/mobile-phone/Build-app-30781073/details)

My project is about Progressive Overload. It is an app that is intended for an audience that goes to the gym regularly and lifts weight. Progressive Overload is an important aspect when it comes to lifting weights and people usually do not have a good way to track it - It is disorganized that is why I wish to have an app made, for it to be feasibly tracked. There will be selection of exercises in the app which the users themselves add. Then they enter the "reps", "sets" and "weight" after the workout for the exercise that was selected. There should be a view page in the app where the progress of each workout is written and shown in a graphical format. Based off this, the user can track their progressive overload. It is a very simple app and the wireframes are attached. Would love it if someone could have a look and make it. The app should preferably be made using React and should be functional on any device. Please feel free to contact for any details needed on it.

```bash
vim .env
